>2. Information Leakage in Distributed Ledgers

2. 分布式账本技术中的信息泄露

>To understand why information leakage can occur, it is useful to first set out the distinction between centralized and decentralized systems, and how their differences affect transactions processing. Centralized systems (for example, exchanges) are straightforward: they have a single party, usually in a single location, processing transactions and assigning timestamps to them. Decentralized systems (for example, the Bitcoin blockchain) are much more complex: there is no single party, and instead it relies on a network of independent parties geographically dispersed executing an algorithm to process transactions. The most relevant part of this process for the focus of our paper is the sequencing of transactions, where each transaction is assigned a timestamp and an order relative to every other transaction. As we will discuss, it is the limitations of this sequencing process that sets the stage for information leakage to occur.

为了理解信息泄露为什么会发生,首先有必要了解集中式系统和分散式系统的区别，以及他们对交易产生对不同影响。集中式系统（例如外币兑换）是明确的：通常有一个单方面的机构，来处理交易进程和分配时间戳。分散式系统（例如比特币）则复杂得多：没有独立多机构，相反它依赖一个由地理位置上分散的且互相独立的机构组成的网络通过一种算法来进行交易。本文关注的最有意义的一点就是交易的时序，在这个时序中每笔交易被打上时间戳以及与其他任意一笔交易的先后顺序。正如我们想提出的，这个交易时序进程的限制导致了信息泄漏的发生。
