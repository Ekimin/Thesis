# 摘要

>This paper examines information leakage in distributed ledgers. We show how the lack of time priority in the period between the publication of a transaction and its validation by miners or designated participants can expose a transaction’s “footprint” to the market, resulting in potential front-running and manipulation. We propose a cryptology-based approach for solving information leakage problems in distributed ledgers that relies on using a “hash” (or mathematical identifier) to secure time-priority followed by a second communication revealing more features of the underlying market transaction. Solving the information leakage problem greatly expands the potential applications of private distributed ledger technology.

这篇文章研究了分布式账本技术中的信息泄露问题。我们演示了在交易的公布到比特币矿机或者特定参与者证实交易有效这段时间中，缺乏时序是怎样揭示出交易走向市场的“脚印”，从而导致潜在的非法预先交易和操作。为了解决分布式账本技术中信息泄露问题，我们提出了一个基于密码学的方法。该方法通过“哈希”（或者其他数学标识符）和紧随其后的可以显示更多潜在市场交易信息的二次通讯信息来确保交易时序。信息泄露问题的解决可以增加个人分布式账本技术的潜在应用。

# 引言

>Advocates of the blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underlies Bitcoin,see an almost limitless future for the innovation. Apart from its role in cryptocurrencies,distributed ledger technologies are being developed to handle stock trades, clear and settle leveraged loans, handle catastrophe reinsurance, keep track of land titles and transactions,track the ownership of intellectual properties, facilitate peer-to-peer marketplaces – the list goes on and on. Much of the appeal of the blockchain lies in its use of a decentralized distributed ledger technology in which an immutable single record emerges of the various transactions encased in the blocks. The ability to trade assets in such a setting, along with the emergence of new “smart contracts” that can automatically trigger additional steps such as recording ownership changes or authorizing payments, can have, in the words of the Bank of England, “far-reaching implications for the financial industry”.

用于比特币中的分布式账本技术——区块链技术的先驱者，见证了它在技术革命中的广泛应用前景。除了在加密货币中的应用，分布式账本技术还广泛应用于股票交易， 解决杠杆贷款问题，处理巨灾再保险，跟踪解决土地所有权相关事务，知识产权的所有权鉴定，促进P2P市场发展等等。区块链的吸引力很大程度上来自于其使用分散的分布式账本技术，该技术通过不可变单记录反映区块中各种可变的事务。分布式账本技术处理资产交易的能力，连同可以自动触发额外步骤如记录交易变化的所有者或者授权支付的“智慧合同”的出现，将对金融业产生深远的影响。

>While not disputing this rosy outlook, we argue in this paper that this new technology comes with some very old problems. In particular, a fundamental problem facing traders in traditional market settings is how to hide their trades and trading intentions from other traders. Disguising a trade’s “footprint” is necessary to keep others from copying, or even worse, “front-running” your trades, thereby extracting rents that should have been yours. A variety of algorithmic and technological solutions are dedicated to this task in current markets. As we discuss here, the same information leakage can take place in a distributed ledger setting. This problem arises because even though the blocks in the blockchain are time-stamped, there is no actual time priority in the process of getting a transaction validated and onto the distributed ledger. One contribution of our paper is to show how information leakage can arise in the interim period between the publication of such a transaction and its validation by miners or designated participants, exposing participants in a distributed ledger to potential front-running and manipulation.

首先，本文主要探讨伴随这项新技术产生的一些古老的问题，而不是争论其乐观的前景。比如，在传统贸易市场中，交易者面对的一个基本问题就是怎样隐藏他们自己的交易和交易倾向。伪装交易的“足迹”是为了保障交易不被他人复制和不被他人非法预先交易而获取了本属于自己的利益。在目前的市场中，已经有许多技术解决方案应用于解决这个问题。我们要在这里讨论的是，类似的信息泄露问题同样发生在分布式账本技术中，即使区块链有时间戳，这个问题仍然越发频繁地发生，在分布式账本技术中验证一个事务有效是没有真正的时间有序的。我们的文章的贡献之一就是展示了信息泄露是怎样在类似事务的公布和其被矿机或者指定参与者验证这段时间升温的，从而导致这些参与者走向潜在的非法预先交易和操作。

A second, and perhaps more important, contribution of this paper is to suggest a solution. We propose a cryptology-based approach for solving information leakage problems in  distributed ledgers. Our two-part process uses a “hash” (or mathematical identifier) to secure time-priority which is then followed by a second communication revealing more features of the  underlying market transaction. Because the initial hash does not reveal details of the trade, the ability to front-run a transaction before it is stored in the distributed ledger is curtailed. This  solution essentially removes the ability to manipulate the order of transactions and so restores time priority to the validation process.

其次，这篇文章更加重要的贡献在于提供了解决方案。我们提出了一个基于密码学的方法解决分布式账本技术中的信息泄露问题

# 2. Information Leakage in Distributed Ledgers

2.分布式账本技术中的信息泄露

>To understand why information leakage can occur, it is useful to first set out the distinction between centralized and decentralized systems, and how their differences affect transactions processing. Centralized systems (for example, exchanges) are straightforward: they have a single party, usually in a single location, processing transactions and assigning timestamps to them. Decentralized systems (for example, the Bitcoin blockchain) are much more complex: there is no single party, and instead it relies on a network of independent parties geographically dispersed executing an algorithm to process transactions. The most relevant part of this process for the focus of our paper is the sequencing of transactions, where each transaction is assigned a timestamp and an order relative to every other transaction. As we will discuss, it is the limitations of this sequencing process that sets the stage for information leakage to occur.

为了理解信息泄露为什么会发生,首先有必要了解集中式系统和分散式系统的区别，以及他们对交易产生对不同影响。集中式系统（例如外币兑换）是明确的：通常有一个单方面的机构，来处理交易进程和分配时间戳。分散式系统（例如比特币）则复杂得多：没有独立多机构，相反它依赖一个由地理位置上分散的且互相独立的机构组成的网络通过一种算法来进行交易。本文关注的最有意义的一点就是交易的时序，在这个时序中每笔交易被打上时间戳以及与其他任意一笔交易的先后顺序。正如我们想提出的，这个交易时序进程的限制导致了信息泄漏的发生。
