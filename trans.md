>This paper examines information leakage in distributed ledgers. We show how the lack of time
priority in the period between the publication of a transaction and its validation by miners or
designated participants can expose a transaction’s “footprint” to the market, resulting in
potential front-running and manipulation. We propose a cryptology-based approach for solving
information leakage problems in distributed ledgers that relies on using a “hash” (or
mathematical identifier) to secure time-priority followed by a second communication revealing
more features of the underlying market transaction. Solving the information leakage problem
greatly expands the potential applications of private distributed ledger technology.
